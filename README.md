# Hanoi Air Quality Analysis
## I. Introduction
Welcome to my project dedicated to analyzing the air quality in Hanoi over the period from March 2023 to March 2024. My passion for air quality research stems from the desire to raise awareness about the air we breathe every day. Many people in Hanoi are not fully aware of the factors influencing the city's air quality, nor the potential health impacts associated with it.

In this project, I delve into the intricacies of Hanoi's air quality, exploring the effects of different weather conditions, seasonal variations, and hourly patterns of pollution. By presenting this analysis, I hope to shed light on the critical air quality issues facing Hanoi and provide valuable insights for residents, researchers, and policymakers alike.

Join me on this journey as we uncover the key factors affecting Hanoi's air quality and work towards a cleaner, healthier future for our city.
