## I. Introduction
My passion for researching Hanoi's air quality was sparked last year when I returned to Hanoi in October, during the worst AQI levels of the year. The air was thick and hard to breathe, and I found myself constantly checking the AQI on the IQAir app before going outside. Around that time, I also read an article from the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/as-a-chest-surgeon-i-see-the-effects-of-air-pollution-inside-every-patient/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social_video&utm_term=1_1&utm_content=28072_Indian_surgeon_polluted_lungs&utm_campaign=social_video_2023) that highlighted how air pollution affects every cell in the body. This could explain why so many residents of Hanoi experienced sore throats and illnesses from October to December 2023. Observing the severe impact of air pollution inspired me to start this project on Hanoi air quality analysis. My goal is to provide insights into the city's air pollution, helping people in my hometown become more aware and take appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to harmful air.

Welcome to my project dedicated to analyzing the air quality in Hanoi over the period from March 2023 to March 2024. In this project, I delve into the intricacies of Hanoi's air quality, exploring the effects of different weather conditions, seasonal variations, and hourly patterns of pollution. By presenting this analysis, I hope to shed light on the critical air quality issues facing Hanoi and provide valuable insights for residents, researchers, and policymakers alike.

Join me on this journey as we uncover the key factors affecting Hanoi's air quality and work towards a cleaner, healthier future for our city.
